# Azure Arc Governance — Windows AHB & SQL License Policies

## Overview

Two custom Azure Policy definitions enforce licensing posture on the Azure Arc–enabled estate:

| # | Policy | Target resource | Effect | Purpose |
|---|--------|-----------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Activate Azure Benefits for Windows Arc Machines** | `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines` | DeployIfNotExists | Enables Software Assurance / Azure Hybrid Benefit on licensed Windows Server Arc machines |
| 2 | **Set Arc SQL Server License Type** | `Microsoft.AzureArcData/sqlServerInstances` (detect) → `Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/extensions` (remediate) | DeployIfNotExists | Sets SQL Server license type via the SQL Server extension |

Both use a system-assigned managed identity granted **least-privilege** roles at the assignment scope — **Azure Connected Machine Resource Administrator** (`cd570a14-e51a-42ad-bac8-bafd67325302`) plus **Reader** — and require a **remediation task** to bring existing resources into compliance (DINE only auto-triggers on resource create/update). Roles are only required for the `DeployIfNotExists` effect; `AuditIfNotExists` assignments need no identity or role.

## Policy 1 — Windows Azure Hybrid Benefit

- Scope: `osType = windows` and `licenseProfile.licenseStatus = Licensed` (unlicensed servers are intentionally skipped).
- Remediation writes `licenseProfile.softwareAssurance.softwareAssuranceCustomer = true` via the `machines/licenseProfiles` resource.
- **Design note:** the definition is deliberately **version-agnostic**. Earlier 2025-specific logic (Pay-as-you-go `productProfile`) was removed because those fields do not exist on 2016/2019/2022 builds and caused null-parameter deployment failures — the symptom being "only 2025 machines remediate." The current single-condition design applies uniformly to all supported Windows Server versions.

## Policy 2 — SQL Server License Type

### Key technical difference (important)

`Microsoft.AzureArcData/sqlServerInstances.licenseType` is a **read-only projection** — it reports the license type but cannot be written directly. The authoritative setting lives in the **Azure extension for SQL Server** (`WindowsAgent.SqlServer`, publisher `Microsoft.AzureData`) as `settings.LicenseType`.

Consequently, the policy **detects** and **remediates** on the SQL Server **extension** (`Microsoft.HybridCompute/machines/extensions`, `*Agent.SqlServer`), setting `settings.LicenseType`. A common early mistake is to target the `sqlServerInstances` resource for remediation — that deployment does not persist because the value is owned by the extension. The adopted definition is sourced from Microsoft's [`sql-server-samples`](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/manage/azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/compliance/arc-sql-license-type-compliance).

### Operational caveats

- **Existing extension settings are preserved.** The adopted Microsoft definition reads the current settings and applies `union(existingSettings, licenseSettings)`, merging only `LicenseType` (and, for PAYG, `ConsentToRecurringPAYG`). Exclusion lists, patching/ESU config, and other settings are retained.
- **Scope control via `licenseTypesToOverwrite`** (state-based), not a tag: choose which current license states (`Unspecified`/`Paid`/`PAYG`/`LicenseOnly`) are eligible for change. **Server+CAL–licensed instances must remain `LicenseOnly`** and can be protected by omitting `LicenseOnly` from the overwrite list.
- **PAYG consent** is registered automatically when `targetLicenseType = PAYG` (required for recurring pay-as-you-go, e.g., CSP-managed subscriptions).
- After remediation, the `sqlServerInstances.licenseType` projection updates only after the extension reports back (projection lag of minutes up to ~1 hour); the policy uses `evaluationDelay: AfterProvisioningSuccess` to accommodate this.

## The three options for setting SQL license type

| Option | Mechanism | Best for | Key limitations |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| **A. Azure Policy (DINE)** | Deploys `WindowsAgent.SqlServer` extension with `LicenseType` | Continuous governance, drift detection/correction across the estate | Overwrites extension settings; applies one value uniformly; no awareness of Server+CAL or PAYG consent |
| **B. Onboarding tag** — `ArcSQLServerExtensionDeployment = Paid` / `PAYG` on subscription/RG/machine | Honored by the SQL auto-deploy workflow at onboarding | Governing **new** instances as they connect | Does **not** change already-onboarded instances; onboarding-time only |
| **C. `modify-license-type.ps1`** (Microsoft SQL samples) | Updates the extension while **preserving** existing settings and registering PAYG consent | Bulk changes to **existing** fleet and license-agreement transitions | Manual/scheduled execution; not continuous enforcement |

## Recommended approach

A layered model rather than any single mechanism:

1. **New onboarding → Option B (tag).** Set `ArcSQLServerExtensionDeployment` on the subscription/RG so every newly connected SQL instance gets the correct license type automatically. Use `PAYG-Recurring` for CSP-managed subscriptions (records required consent).
2. **Existing fleet & transitions → Option C (script).** Use Microsoft's supported [`modify-license-type.ps1`](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/manage/azure-arc-enabled-sql-server/modify-license-type) for the initial bulk change and for any Software Assurance/subscription → PAYG transitions. It preserves existing extension settings and handles consent — the two things the policy cannot do.
3. **Ongoing compliance → Option A (policy).** Run Policy 2 in **`AuditIfNotExists`** mode as the estate-wide compliance monitor/reporting control. Only promote specific scopes to **`DeployIfNotExists`** where machines have **no custom extension settings** and are confirmed BYOL/SA-entitled, and always pair enforcement with the **exclusion tag** to protect instances with exclusion lists, PAYG consent, or Server+CAL licensing.

**Rationale:** the PowerShell script is the safest instrument for changing values on existing machines because it is non-destructive to other extension settings and understands billing consent; the policy is the right instrument for *visibility and drift prevention*, not for the initial bulk mutation. Using DINE as the primary change tool across a heterogeneous fleet risks clobbering exclusion lists/consent and mislabeling Server+CAL instances.

## Licensing correctness note

`Paid` asserts coverage by SQL Server Software Assurance or a subscription license (BYOL). Applying `Paid` to instances without that entitlement misrepresents licensing; `PAYG` bills hourly through Azure. License type selection must align with actual entitlement per instance.
